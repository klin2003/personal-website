# My Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! Here, I showcase some of the projects and skills that I have honed over my career. This site is built to serve as a portfolio of sorts for some of the notable projects that I have worked on, or am still working on. Feel free to take a look at some of the source code for how the website was built, or check out the actual website through the following link: [Personal Website](https://klin2003.github.io/personal-website)

This project is built using a **React + Vite + TypeScript** core and utilizes **Tailwind CSS** for the website's overall design and layout.  

For visuals, the site incorporates:  
- **[react-awesome-reveal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-awesome-reveal)** for Fade effects
- **[react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)** for scalable SVG icons  
- **[Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/)** for the background image to the site
- **[Hero Patterns](https://heropatterns.com/)** for subtle SVG backgrounds
